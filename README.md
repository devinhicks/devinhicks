- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @devinhicks, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Simulation Science, Games, and Animation from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 
That mouthful is to say: I'm looking for a job! My skills range from 3D modeling in Maya and ZBrush to designing, programming, and implementing games in Unity3D.
I'm very comfortable with C# and C, anf familiar with C++, Python, HTML5, JavaScript, and WebGL.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a variety of positions in game development, whether that be UI/UX design, gameplay progamming, full stack development on an app, optimizing
for mobile, VR or AR, character design, story development - pretty much everything! I want to work in different settings with different teams to learn as much as
I can!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit about full stack dev so I can potentially get a job in software engineering. I'm also learning about Unreal Engine 4/5 
and Houdini to improve my rendering and lighting skills. But, of course, I'm always learning a little more about everything else as I work on projects!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me an email at devinhicks.az@gmail.com - I check it frequently :)
