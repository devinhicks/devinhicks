                         <h3>Hi there! I'm Devin (she/her), and I aspire to make games in the pursuit of becoming the best developer I can be -</h3>
                         <p>
                             so that the games I make can reconnect players with their inner child, and remind them of the joys of playing*. My specific focus is on UI/UX development and technical art, but I’m eager to learn as much as possible to strengthen my skillset and creative potential. You can find me still trying to finish any game I've ever started, out thrifting for tchotchkes, or reading something of the fantasy romance variety.

                     <p>
                         <strong>I wonder at the strange and serendipitous pathways of life that brought us to this moment -</strong> you, reading this, and me, having written it at all. My personal journey into the world of game development began at The Computer (you know, the shared desktop that the whole family used) playing Zoo Tycoon and The Sims 2. It then looped through the Age of the Wii, rocketed through party games, and found a peculiar place amongst my first year in college - as an Astronomy major. While my perfect physics lab scores were certainly impressive, my passion for the subject wasn’t anything to write home about. So, in my most desperate hour avoiding assigned readings, I made a decision that quite literally changed the course of my life: I bought the Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword for my WiiU.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Amidst the many stressors of academia, I hadn’t afforded myself the time to do the one thing I truly, deeply love: sitting by myself, in a dark room, wrapped in a blanket, pushing little buttons to make the man on the screen roll around and throw chickens so I can hear the little jingle when he kicks open a treasure chest. The simple joy in finding a key or solving a puzzle quickly filled the spaces that my classes were beginning to carve out of me - and I found myself wishing I could do the same for others. In a matter of days I had planned out how to fit an entirely different degree into 3 years, and became a Simulation Science, Games, and Animation major, the best and easiest decision I’ve ever made.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        In many ways, the work of a Sims and Games major was easy. We play games, talk about games, and think about games. But making games - designing the perfect player experience, balancing challenge and skill, understanding the way a story can weave its way into everything from the look of an NPC to the layout of the menu - making games is where I found everything I was looking for. A space to fill with my overactive imagination, a challenge to satiate my inner scientist, a community that understands what I’m there for without becoming an echo chamber (as long as you stay away from Reddit). I’ve yet to find a part of the game development process that doesn’t intrigue me - if I don’t know it now, I’m positive I’ll learn it eventually.
